            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h5>Engineer</h5>
            <p>
              I am an aspiring Computer Science Engineer (CSE) currently
              pursuing my degree at Medicaps University. I have completed my
              second year and am on track to graduate in the year 2025. With a
              passion for programming and software development, my goal is to
              become the best developer I can be. I have a strong desire to
              continue learning throughout my life, keeping up with the
              ever-evolving field of technology.<br />
              In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, immersing myself in
              virtual worlds, and experiencing interactive storytelling.
              Additionally, I also have a fondness for outdoor games, which
              provide me with a healthy balance of physical activity and
              recreation. <br />
              My dedication to becoming an exceptional developer and my
              enthusiasm for lifelong learning will undoubtedly propel me
              towards a successful career in the field of Computer Science
              Engineering. I will continue to pursue my passions and interests,
              and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
